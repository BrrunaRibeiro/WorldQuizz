# WorldQuizz

[WorldQuizz](https://brrunaribeiro.github.io/project-2/)

World Quizz was created with the intention to bring general knowledge about Travel, Geography and Local Curiosities. 
You will find the questions not difficult to answer, it's probably things you already heard of, back in school or while traveling yourself, and otherwise, you might have just aggregated some knowledge.

For each question, there are three options for answer, from which, only ONE is correct. The game features a countdown timer which is at the top-right corner, you have 10 seconds to answer the question. When the timer runs out, you are redirected to the next question and your score remains the same.
There are 5 questions in total. You score +1 for each correctly answered question.

After 5 questions, you will see your final score.
