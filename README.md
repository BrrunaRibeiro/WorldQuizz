# WorldQuizz

![WorldQuizz](https://brrunaribeiro.github.io/project-2/)

World Quizz was created with the intention to bring general knowledge about Travel, Geography and Local Curiosity. 
You will find the questions not difficult to answer, it's probably things you already heard of back in school or while traveling yourself, otherwise, you just agregated knowledge.

You have one question, and three options for answer, from which only one is correct. A countdown timer is at the top-right corner, you have 10 seconds to answer the question.
After selecting the question, you will see the correct answer becomes green. If you selected the wrong answer, the selected answer becomes red, and the correct answer green, so you can still learn even if you answered wrong.
You can move to the next question. There are 10 questions in total. 
A scorebord in the end screen will display your score based on how many questions you answered correctly.

    ## AUTOMATED TESTING

The Automated Testing includes all the testing that is carried out by a program, like W3C HTML validation.

### ¬†W3C Validator

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed W3C HTML & CSS validation section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms/blob/main/TESTING.md#W3C-Validator)

The most popular HTML validator is [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/). There are two ways to validate the HTML for your first milestone - you can copy the live link for your site page and paste into the validate by URI field, or you can copy all the code for your page and paste this into the validate by direct input field.

#### **URI Input**

If you validate with your sites URL, you can run the validation and then copy the link from the address bar and insert the link here as your proof of validation.

#### **Direct Input**

If you validate with the code, you will need to screenshot the validation results and then link the image here.

![W3C Direct Input Validator](documentation/milestone1-testing/w3c-directinput-validation.png)

#### **CSS Validation**

CSS Validation can only be done by copying and pasting the CSS file contents into the direct input. Make sure that the checkbox for CSS is selected.

### Lighthouse

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed lighthouse testing section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022/blob/main/TESTING.md#Lighthouse)

Lighthouse Testing is part of the Chrome Developer Tools. For more information on how to use this tool, please visit [chrome Lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=en#:~:text=Lighthouse%20is%20an%20open%2Dsource,how%20well%20the%20page%20did.).

You will need to run the Lighthouse testing on each individual page of your site, for desktop as a minimum. If you have time it would be great to also add in the mobile testing.

### WAVE

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed WAVE testing section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022/blob/main/TESTING.md#WAVE)

[WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) is an accessibility testing tool. I like to run this on each page of my site and take a screenshot of the results to add here. They have a website for testing and a Chrome extension.
