# WorldQuizz

[WorldQuizz](https://brrunaribeiro.github.io/project-2/)

World Quizz was created with the intention to bring general knowledge about Travel, Geography and Local Curiosity. 
You will find the questions not difficult to answer, it's probably things you already heard of back in school or while traveling yourself, otherwise, you just aggregated knowledge.

You have one question, and three options for answer, from which only one is correct. A countdown timer is at the top-right corner, you have 10 seconds to answer the question.
There are 5 questions in total. 
An alert will display your score based on how many questions you answered correctly out of 5.
